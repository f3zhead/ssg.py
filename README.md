# ssg.py  
A static site generator, written in python.

This is essentially a python drop-in replacement for pryme-svg's [modified version](https://parabolas.xyz/blog/files/ssg6) of Roman Zolotarev's [ssg6](https://rgz.ee/bin/ssg6).

**License:** GPLv3 or later

**Dependencies:**
python >= 3.5  
[pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc)  
[python-feedgen](https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen) (optional, for generating RSS and Atom feeds)

*Note:* My code isn't terribly efficient, but I'm too lazy to fix it now so hehe whatever
